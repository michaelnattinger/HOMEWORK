<P>Attached below is a Matlab script file and eight accompanying Matlab
functions that compute the random coefficients discrete choice model
described in "A Practitioner's Guide to Estimation of Random
Coefficients Logit Models of Demand" (Journal of Economics & Management
Strategy, 9(4), 513-548, 2000) and "Measuring Market Power in the
Ready-to-Eat Cereal Industry" (Econometrica, 69(2), 307-342, 2001).

<P>The code is provided for academic research. Users of this code (or a
modified version of it) should reference the above papers. The code includes
minimal documentation, and is provided with out any additional support.
The code was successfully run using Matlab 5.1 on a Windows NT operating
system. Questions regarding Matlab should be referred to <A
HREF="http://www.mathworks.com">MathWorks</A>.

<P>The data used by this program is described in the file
<a href="supplementary%20materials/data.htm">readme.html.</a>
These data were motivated by real scanner data; however, they are not real
and should not be used to make any inference. The only purpose these data
serve is to provide an example of the inputs required by the program. The
results I obtained can be found in
<a href="supplementary%20materials/results.txt">results.txt. </a>

<P>The program consists of the following files (all Matlab m-files):
<BR><A HREF="rc_dc.m">rc_dc.m</A> - A script file that reads in the data
and calls the other functions;
<BR><a href="Data&Code/gmmobj.m">gmmobj.m </a>- This function computes the GMM objective
function;
<BR><A HREF="meanval.m">meanval.m</A> - This function computes the mean
utility level;
<BR><a href="Data&Code/mufunc.m">mufunc.m</a> - This function computes the non-linear
part of the utility (mu_ijt in the Guide);
<BR><a href="mktsh.m">mktsh.m</a> - This function computes the market share
for each product;
<BR><a href="ind_sh.m">ind_sh.m</a> - This function computes the "individual"
probabilities of choosing each brand;
<BR><A HREF="gradobj.m">gradobj.m</A> - This function computes the gradient
of the objective function;
<BR><A HREF="jacob.m">jacob.m</A> - This function computes the Jacobian
of the implicit function that defines the mean utility;
<BR><A HREF="var_cov.m">var_cov.m</A> - This function computes the VCov
matrix of the estimates.
<BR><A HREF="cr_dum.m">cd_dum.m</A> - This function creates a set of
dummy variables
